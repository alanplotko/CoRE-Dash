## About CoREdash

CoREdash is a web application that serves to enable members and alumni of Binghamton University's CoRE (Computers, Robotics, and Engineering) Living/Learning Community to stay in touch and organize events. CoRE is a Special Interest Housing option that consists of members who share interests in computers, robotics, and engineering.

## Planned Features

- ~~Google Sign-in~~ >> **Added in 0.1.0-alpha**

- Organize, host, and attend events
  - Members can upload their class eschedules to help in event planning
  - Members can list recurring times in which they have commitments to clubs and other activities in which they cannot attend an event
- Upload documents
  - Use Google Drive API to fetch CoRE documents for reading
  - Integrate forms into the application rather than sending links via email
- Send automated emails via the application for CoRE meetings
