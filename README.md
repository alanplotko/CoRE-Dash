## About CoREdash

CoREdash is a web application that serves to enable members and alumni of Binghamton University's CoRE (Computers, Robotics, and Engineering) Living/Learning Community to stay in touch and organize events. CoRE is a Special Interest Housing option that consists of members who share interests in computers, robotics, and engineering.

## Usage

Just visit the website. CoRE members can sign in with Google using their Binghamton University email address. After logging in, members can navigate and interact with the web application.

Note: For the duration of alpha development, access will only be given to CoRE members contributing to project development and testing.

## Technologies

CoREdash runs in Python 3 on Flask and MongoDB. You can checkout the modules in use in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/alanplotko/CoREdash/blob/master/requirements.txt). I particularly use Python 3.4.3.

## Setup

After forking the project, set the following environment variables:

config.py
- consumer_key:  Consumer key for google sign in
- consumer_secret: Consumer secret for google sign in

app.py
- SESSION_MONGODB_DB: MongoDB database name
- SESSION_MONGODB_COLLECT: MongoDB table name for sessions
- SESSION_KEY_PREFIX: MongoDB prefix for sessions
- APP_SECRET_KEY: Secret key for app generated by running

You can generate a secret key by running the following in Python:

```
>>> import os
>>> os.urandom(24)
'\xfd{H\xe5<\x95\xf9\xe3\x96.5\xd1\x01O<!\xd5\xa2\xa0\x9fR"\xa1\xa8'
```

You can read more about this secret key in the "How to generate good secret keys" section on the [Flask Docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#sessions).

Now you're ready to create a virtual environment and install the requirements listed in requirements.txt

1) Install virtualenv if you have not already.

```
pip install virtualenv
```

2) Create a virtual environment in your project directory.

```
virtualenv venv
```

3) Activate the virtual environment.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

4) Install requirements from requirements.txt

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

5) Run CoREdash. I use an alias (python=python3) when working in a Linux environment. Be sure to appropriately modify these commands based on your environment (i.e. using python3 or pip3 where appropriate and so on).

```
python app.py
```
